# Multi-Omics Analysis of Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease Risk Factors in Microglia

## Project Overview
Microglia, the brain‚Äôs resident immune cells, play a crucial role in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer‚Äôs, glaucoma, and multiple sclerosis. However, the mechanisms linking non-coding genetic risk variants to dysregulated gene expression remain poorly understood.

This project integrates multi-omics data‚Äîincluding differential gene expression profiles, microglia-specific cis-regulatory elements (CREs) from ATAC-seq, and transcription factor (TF) networks inferred from single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and protein interaction databases‚Äîto uncover key regulatory mechanisms driving Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD) pathology.

## Objectives
- Conduct differential expression analysis on RNA-seq data to assess the impact of AD risk factors on microglial gene regulation.
- Integrate ATAC-seq and bulk RNA-seq data to identify key regulatory elements and transcription factors (TFs) associated with expression changes.
- Investigate additional risk factors beyond IFN-beta and explore regulatory changes using scRNA-seq data.
- Map disease-associated genes to their regulatory elements using eQTL data and TF-mediated interactions.
